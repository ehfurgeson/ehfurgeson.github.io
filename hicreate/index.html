        <h3>Scale Model Sears Tower</h3>
        <h6>These are laser cut and etched scale model sears tower christmas ornaments, however they can also be just models to display on your desk. I designed the laser cutting and etching using proffesional laser cutting software while making sure to keep the floors, windows, and sections all to scale.</h6>

        <h3>Frog Box</h3>
        <h6>Laser cut and etched diorama of a bog, with the primary focus being the jumping frog and flies. I designed the laser cutting and etching using proffesional laser cutting software. This project was a labor of love and I spent a ton of time drawing out and making everything look perfect digitally, however due to the limitations of laser etching onto wood a lot of the details did not shine through as much as I wanted, however I am still very proud of the results.</h6>

        <p>There are messed up screw holes on the side because my teacher forced me to use the premade box template, also I wanted to use glue instead of screws, but once again, my teacher made me use the screw template for the box.</p>

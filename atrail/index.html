                    eventually I will likely replace this by inputting all the data of the shelters and stuff from this google map into a leaflet or something akin to it
                    this will make it so that there can be more interactivity and such, but for now this is simple and pre made to get made quickly
                    here is a list of different possiblities of things I could use

                    1. Google Maps: This is a widely used mapping service that provides comprehensive and accurate map data. It also offers various customization options1.

                    2. Leaflet: This is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It’s lightweight and has all the features most developers need for online maps1.

                    3. Mapbox: This service provides customizable maps for websites and applications. It’s used by several large companies and offers robust features1.

                    4. OpenLayers: This is an open-source JavaScript library that allows you to load, display, and render maps from multiple sources on web pages12.

                    5. OpenStreetMap: This is a community-driven map service where anyone can contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more1.
